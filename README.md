# Taxi Service Project

I have created this "Taxi Service" project to demonstrate my expertise in Java Core, object-oriented programming, and web technology. In this web application, you can register or authenticate a driver, create a new car or manufacturer that will be added to the database. Additionally, in this app, you can add a driver to a car and look at the list of all cars that our driver uses.

### Features
- Register a new driver, car, or manufacturer.
- Assign a driver to a car.
- View a list of all drivers, cars, and manufacturers.
- Delete existing data.
